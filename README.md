## Hi there 👋 I'm Chris!

🚀 Passionate apprentice software engineer | Coding enthusiast | Lifelong learner

🔭 I’m currently working on **a cross-platform fitness and workout log app**.

🌱 I’m currently learning **C++, Linux kernel inner-workings, ergonomic and intuitive UI creation, etc!**

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open source emulator projects**, **applications or software that use generative AI**

💬 Ask me about **the latest hardware trends, ARM architecture, recompilation of old software for newer platforms, UI design philosophy**

❌ DON'T ask me about **Memory Management, C, Compilation** (It's a touchy subject..)
